# Rain Metadata Tooling
A library that provides all the toolings and utilities in order to work with RainLanguage metadata. Dotrain LSP/compiler, Rain Orderbook, etc are a few examples to mention that use this library under the hood.

Also provides CLI app (executable binary) to generate desireable Rain cbor encoded metadata based on [Metadata Specs](https://github.com/rainprotocol/specs/blob/main/metadata-v1.md) which for example is used in Rain deployment CI.

## Features
`cli` and `json-schema` features are default however, in most cases non of the features are needed for using the lib crate, so they can be disabled by using `default-features = false`, just be aware that `cli` feature is required for building the binary.

- `cli`: A [clap](https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/) based CLI crate for functionalities of this library, this feature has [tokio](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/) dependency with features enabled that are compatible for `wasm` family target builds. Enabling this feature will also enable `json-schema` feature, This feature is required for building the binary crate.
- `json-schema`: Enables implementation of Json Schema for different types of Rain meta.
- `tokio-full`: Installs [tokio](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/) with full features which is a dependency of `cli` feature, this allows for multi-threading of the CLI app, however it results in erroneous builds for `wasm` target family as explained in [tokio docs](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/#wasm-support), this feature is only effective for binary crate and using it for lib crate just installs [tokio](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/) with its full features as a dependency as the entire lib crate doesn't depend on [tokio](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/). This is because [tokio](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/) is only used as a runtime for binray crate.

## Examples
### Encode/Decode
Create a meta item and cbor encode/decode it:
```rust
let authoring_meta_content = r#"[
    {
        "word": "stack",
        "description": "Copies an existing value from the stack.",
        "operandParserOffset": 16
    },
    {
        "word": "constant",
        "description": "Copies a constant value onto the stack.",
        "operandParserOffset": 16
    }
]"#;
let authoring_meta: AuthoringMeta = serde_json::from_str(authoring_meta_content)?;

// abi encode the authoring meta with performing validation
let authoring_meta_abi_encoded = authoring_meta.abi_encode_validate()?;

// Constructing a RainMeta item (cbor map)
let meta_map = RainMetaDocumentV1Item {
    payload: serde_bytes::ByteBuf::from(authoring_meta_abi_encoded),
    magic: KnownMagic::AuthoringMetaV1,
    content_type: ContentType::Cbor,
    content_encoding: ContentEncoding::None,
    content_language: ContentLanguage::None,
};

// cbor encode the meta item
let cbor_encoded = meta_map.cbor_encode()?;

// decode the data back
let cbor_decoded_vec = RainMetaDocumentV1Item::cbor_decode(&cbor_encoded)?;

// unpack the payload into AuthoringMeta
let unpacked_payload: AuthoringMeta = cbor_decoded_vec[0].unpack_into()?;
```
<br>

### Meta Storage (CAS)
`Store` is a struct that provides functionalities to store, read, fetch(remotely) Rain metadata and ExpressionDeployers as a Content Addressed Storage(CAS), which is a critical piece of dotrain language server protocol and compiler implementation by caching all that is imported in .rain file that can be later accessed easily by language server and compiler.
```rust
use rain_meta::meta::Store;
use std::collections::HashMap;

// to instatiate with default rain subgraphs included
let mut store = Store::default();

// add a new subgraph endpoint url to the subgraph list
store.add_subgraphs(&vec!["subgraph-url"]);

// update the store with another Store (merges the stores)
store.merge(&Store::default());

// hash of a meta to search and store
let hash = "0x56ffc3fc82109c33f1e1544157a70144fc15e7c6e9ae9c65a636fd165b1bc51c";

// updates the meta store with a new meta by searching through subgraphs
store.update(&hash);

// searches for an deployer in the subgraphs and stores the result mapped to the hash
store.search_deployer(&hash);

// to get a record from store
let meta = store.get_meta(&hash);

// to get a ExpressionDeployer record from store
let deployer_record = store.get_deployer(&hash);

// path to a .rain file
let dotrain_uri = "path/to/file.rain";

// reading the dotrain content as an example,
// Store is agnostic to dotrain contents it just maps the hash of the content to the given
// uri and puts it as a new meta into the meta cache, so obtaining and passing the correct
// content is up to the implementer
let dotrain_content = std::fs::read_to_string(&dotrain_uri);

// updates the dotrain cache for a dotrain text and uri
let (new_hash, old_hash) = store.set_dotrain(&dotrain_content, &dotrain_uri, false)?;

// to get dotrain meta bytes given a uri
let dotrain_meta_bytes = store.get_dotrain_meta(&dotrain_uri);
```

## Developers
To build from source first clone this repo and make sure you already have `rustup` installed and next you can build the lib/binary using `cargo build`, if you have nixOS installed you can simply run:
```bash
nix build
```
to build the binary crate or enter the nix with:
```bash
nix develop
```
which will fetch all the required packages and put them in your path and you can proceed to build lib/binary crate using `cargo build`.
for running test use `cargo test` and for generating docs use `cargo doc`.
